# Conway's Game of Life

Live on [my site!](http://danieledamiani.com/gameOfLife/index.html)

## Rules
 - Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by underpopulation.
 - Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
 - Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
 - Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
